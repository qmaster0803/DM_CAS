Classes structure:

int main() - program entry point
	|
Interactive_shell - UI
	|
Modules (functions from the modules:: namespace)


Interactive shell class description:
UI includes two columns: left column with the interactive shell itself and
right column with the history list of all calculations performed
There are some hotkeys:
	ctrl + q closes the program,
	ctrl + h shows help pages in the right column instead of the history,
			 until thi hotkey is pressed again
	ctrl + z undoes latest change
	ctrl + y redoes latest change
	arrow up/down recalls latest commands
	ctrl + arrow up/down recalles latest command results


Module functions:
All of the module classes must be called the same way as mentioned in the
technical description given by the lector. They must be available by the
same names in the UI (like classical functions, COMM_NN_D(a, b) etc.).
Also, some of them should have easy-to-use aliases:

COMMAND     | ALIAS
---------------------------
COMM_NN_D   | a == b
ADD_1N_N    | a ++
ADD_NN_N    | a + b
SUB_NN_N    | a >-< b
MUL_ND_N    | a *1 b
MUL_Nk_N    | a ^10 k
MUL_NN_N    | a * b
SUB_NDN_N   |
DIV_NN_Dk   |
DIV_NN_N    | a // b
MOD_NN_N    | a % b
GCF_NN_N    |
LCM_NN_N    |
